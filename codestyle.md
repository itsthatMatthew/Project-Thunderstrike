# Project-wide Code Style Guidelines

> `!` The current document is a proposal. Things are subject to change.

The following document aims to give a thorough and detailed guide on the coding style and standard of the project. Following this code-style is necessary and helpful in making everyone's code clear, readable and easy to maintain. Not following these guidelines may result in your code being prejected.
