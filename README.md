# Project-Thunderstrike

Demo bomb-defusal game project mostly for airsoft games and other sorts of activity, based on an ESP32 micro-controller. Inspired by Keep Talking And Nobody Explodes.

The software implementation is constantly subject to change, hardware implementation's details and graphs may be presented in the future.

The goal is a modular software and hardware design, where new games and tasks can be easily added to the "main board".
